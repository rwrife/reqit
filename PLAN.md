# PokeBot — Build Plan

A VS Code extension for testing REST APIs with first-class auth support.

## Non-Goals

- A Postman clone with a giant GUI. We use `.http` files (text, version-controllable).
- A cloud sync service. Everything is local.
- Telemetry. None.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript (strict), Node >= 20
- HTTP: `undici` (HTTP/2, easy `Agent` for client certs)
- Bundler: `esbuild`
- Tests: `@vscode/test-electron` (integration), `vitest` (unit)
- Lint: `eslint` + `@typescript-eslint`, `prettier`
- Webview: Preact + plain CSS
- CI: GitHub Actions (lint, typecheck, test, package `.vsix`)

## Milestones

### M1 — Scaffold + send a request

Acceptance:
- `npm install && npm run build && npm run test` work
- `F5` launches a dev VS Code with the extension loaded
- Open a `.http` file, see syntax highlighting for the basic format
- Codelens "Send Request" above a request → response shown in a webview panel
- Method + URL + headers + body all parsed
- Response panel shows status, headers, body (pretty JSON if applicable), timing

### M2 — Environments + variables

Acceptance:
- `.http-env.json` per workspace, with named environments
- Picker in status bar to switch active environment
- `{{var}}` substitution in URL, headers, body
- Built-in vars: `{{$guid}}`, `{{$timestamp}}`, `{{$randomInt min max}}`, `{{$datetime iso}}`
- Secrets marked `"$secret": true` resolved from VS Code SecretStorage with a prompt on first use

### M3 — Auth, the whole point

Acceptance:
- Per-request `# @auth <name>` directive that pulls from `.http-auth.json`
- Auth providers:
  - `basic` (user/pass, password from SecretStorage)
  - `bearer` (token from SecretStorage)
  - `jwt`:
    - paste-in: signed token from SecretStorage
    - generated: claims + alg + key/secret, signed at request time
    - "Decode JWT" command for inspecting any token
  - `clientCert` (mTLS): PEM (`cert` + `key` + optional `ca` paths) OR `pfx` path; passphrase prompt cached for session
  - `apiKey` (header or query parameter)
- Failing-auth surface: response panel shows decoded WWW-Authenticate / 401 body, with a "fix auth" quick action

### M4 — OAuth2

Acceptance:
- `oauth2` auth provider:
  - `clientCredentials` flow
  - `authorizationCode` w/ PKCE (uses VS Code's external browser + loopback redirect)
- Access tokens cached in SecretStorage with expiry tracking
- "Refresh now" command + automatic refresh on 401

### M5 — Response viewer polish + history

Acceptance:
- Pretty/raw/headers/timing tabs
- Save response to file
- "Diff vs previous response for this request"
- "Copy as curl" command (preserves auth where safe; redacts secrets)
- History view: list of past requests with status/timestamp, click to re-run
- Local-only SQLite (better-sqlite3) or JSON-lines store

### M6 — Run collections + tests

Acceptance:
- `# @test` blocks in `.http` files (small JS expression DSL against the response: `status === 200`, `json.id != null`, etc.)
- "Run file" command — executes all requests sequentially, shows pass/fail summary
- CLI mode: `npx pokebot run requests/smoke.http --env staging` for CI usage

### M7 — Marketplace release

Acceptance:
- Icon + readme + GIF demos
- Publisher set up (`rwrife` or similar)
- v0.1.0 tagged + published
- License: MIT

## Coding Standards

- Strict TypeScript, no `any` without an explicit comment justifying it
- All HTTP options validated with `zod` before being passed to undici
- Pure parser/var-substitution code lives in `src/core/` and is testable without VS Code APIs
- VS Code-specific glue lives in `src/extension/`
- Webview code lives in `src/webview/` and is bundled separately
